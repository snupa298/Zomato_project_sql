# SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

use zomato;

select * from customers;
select * from restaurants;
select * from riders;
select * from deliveries;

## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values.
select count(*) from customers
where customer_name is null

select * from orders
where order_item is null
or
